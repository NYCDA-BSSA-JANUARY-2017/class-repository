Instructions:

- Add your answers inline to the markdown file.
- Use your own words.
- Come up with an answer from memory. Write it down, even if the answer is "I don't know."
- Then, submit all of your answers in a file to canvas. This is so Lloyd and I can get a sense of your understanding.
- Finally, we will go over the answers in class. Write down your revised answer below your original answer.

### Part 1: Control Flow - 15 minutes

1. Write an if statement. Name each of the components and how they work together.

2. Write a for loop. Describe each of its components. Indicate the order in which they are executed / evaluated.

3. Functions
 - 3a. Write a function. Describe each of its components and what each component does. Specify which of them are optional.
 - 3b. Write a function being called, showing the instruction execution order.

 - 4c. Give an example of a Number.

5. Arrays
 - 5a. Give an example of an empty array.
 - 5b. Give an example of an array with three elements in it.
 - 5c. How do you add another element to this array?
 - 5d. How do you get the length of this array?
 - 5e. Show how to iterate through the array using a loop.
 
6. Objects
 - 6e. Give an example of an empty object.
 - 6b. Give an example of an object with three keys and three values.
 - 6c. Give an example of an object with two keys and two functions as values.

### Part 3: Algorithms - 20 minutes

7. What is an algorithm?

8. For the following problem, first write down how exactly to solve the problem in English. Once you are able to describe it in English, translate it into code.

```js
// Given an array of values, write a function that finds the index of where the value is located, and if nothing is found, returns -1.
// Do not use the indexOf function.
// example: for ['apple', 'orange', 'pineapple']
	// 'orange' returns '1'
	// 'durian' returns '-1'
```

9. Again, for the following problem, first write down how exactly to solve the problem in English. Once you are able to describe it in English, translate it into code.

```js
// Write a function that finds all the indexes of where the value is located and returns them in an array, and if nothing is found, returns -1
// example: ['apple', 'orange', 'orange', 'pineapple']
	// 'orange' returns [1,2]
```
